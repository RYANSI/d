# Search-engine-in-PHP-and-MySql
* A very basic search-engine made to see the worth of PHP and Databases !!
* You can add more info into databases and just connect it to php script .
* Using xampp server for PhpMyAdmin .
* ```insert_site.php``` script is used to create databases that will be shown as a result for query on our search-engine . As in 
PhpMyAdmin we can't add images :/ 
* ```result.php``` script is basically fetching the info from the database created with insert_site.php script . And displaying it 
with reference to the specific query given by the user :)
* That's It !!
